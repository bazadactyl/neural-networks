SECTION (0): Very Important Notes

We could not include the entire Tiny ImageNet dataset into
our submission because the TFRecords files are over 1GB in
size. The data in our submissions a reduced version.

------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION (1): Requirements for Running Our Program

To run our program, you will need to have Python 3 and the
ubiquitous "virtualenv" installed on your system. Besides
that, our Makefile will handle all other requirements.

We have provided an easy-to-use Makefile to help you run our
program.

------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION (2): Training a Tiny ImageNet Classifier from Scratch

To train a new classifier, "cd" into our submission
directory and execute the following commands:

make prepare-venv
source env/bin/activate
python train.py &
python evaluate.py &
tensorboard --logdir=logs

Then, open TensorBoard in your browser to monitor the
classifier's accuracy as it is being trained. You can
also monitor loss, mean-squared error, and other metrics.

The commands above perform the following:

1. Create a virtual environment with the required libraries.
2. Enter the virtual environment.
3. Initialize a new classifier and start training it.
4. Repeatedly evaluate the classifier's accuracy so far.
5. Start TensorBoard to monitor the classifier's accuracy.

To KILL the processes you started, execute the following:

CTRL-C
fg
CTRL-C
fg
CTRL-C

SECTION (3): View Results from our Already-trained Model

Before executing the commands below, make sure you have
killed the processes from SECTION (2) using the instructions
in SECTION (2). We also assume you following the already
created the environment from SECTION (2).

We provided metrics from our already-trained model for you
to view in TensorBoard. To keep the file sizes low, we only
trained for 1 hour. Please keep than in mind!

tensorboard --logdir=trained-logs
