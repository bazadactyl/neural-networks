# Neural Networks

We studied neural networks and applied them to text recognition and face recognition as part of the COMP4107 course at Carleton University.

## Text Recognition

We used neural networks to recognize numbers from the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).

Check out the [write-up](a2/write-up.pdf).

Our best model achieved an accuracy of 96%:
